# Data-Envelopment-Analysis

A study project on 'REAL LIFE APPLICATION OF DATA ENVELOPEMENT ANALYSIS'. 
In this project we have used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric method in optimization and economics to estimate production frontiers of decision making units (DMUs). It includes Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes model (CCR), Banker Charnes Cooper model (BCC) and Slack based measure model (SBM). 
A suitable model is used to calculate efficiency of three campuses of BITS Pilani and the code of the same is attached.
